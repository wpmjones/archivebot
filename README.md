Archive Discords Channels to Google Docs

## /archive
**/archive <optional document name>**
Archives the channel you are in using the name of the channel (see option), provides a link to the archive doc, then waits 10 minutes before deleting the channel. Optional: you can include a document name after /archive if you want to specify a name.

## /search
**/search search string**
Searches existing Google Docs for the text specified. It will search both the title and body of the document, but the search is limited to archived channels housed in the Google Drive account.
You may want to search by clan name or tag, but feel free to search for any text at all.
